# EAT Algorithm Implementation


This repo is an implementation of our paper "**EAT: QoS-Aware Edge-Collaborative AIGC Task Scheduling via Attention-Guided Diffusion Reinforcement Learning**", submitted to IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Quality of Service(IWQoS).

We propose EAT, a QoS-aware Edge-collaborative AIGC Task Scheduling algorithm. In this repo, we deploy the EAT algorithm, along with baseline methods, and implement Stable Diffusion on server nodes for AIGC task scheduling and evaluation.
